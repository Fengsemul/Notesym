<Body>A fierce fire broke out in a cellar in Leopoldstadt on Saturday. The fire department went out with several cars and fought the flames.
A fire department operation in the Leopoldstadt district of Vienna attracted all the attention at midday on Saturday. On the Tabor, there was a fire in a cellar - the entire street was filled with dark smoke a short time later. A few minutes after concerned residents called 911, emergency personnel from the Vienna Professional Fire Department deployed and began fighting the fire. 

 
The press office of the fire department confirmed the operation in an interview with "Heute". 61 Florianis fought the flames with a fire line under breathing protection and then carried out smoke removal measures. The firefighters also controlled the smoky stairwells, as well as affected stores and apartments.

Fortunately, no one was injured, 13 people were cared for by the team of the Wiener Berufsrettung. Due to the large deployment, public transport in the Bruno Marek Allee could only run with delays. The operation lasted a total of over two hours. How the cellar fire started is still under investigation.
The task forces of three fire departments were alerted to a serious traffic accident in Pötting (district of Grieskirchen) in the night to Friday.
The money that the police charged the activists is not a fine. The climate activists may still have to pay this fine. This will be decided by the courts.

The background of the fierce quarrel in the ranks of the Russians is political. The Wagner offensive on the town of Bachmut was for a long time the only section of the front where the Russian invaders still had the initiative and were able to make progress.
Meanwhile, Prigozhin regularly rails not only against a faceless generalship, but also directly against Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu. Not only has he been forbidden to continue recruiting volunteers in the prisons, but urgently needed supplies of ammunition are said to have failed to arrive. As a result, he even accused Shoigu and Chief of General Staff Valery Gerasimov of "high treason".
Russian troops have been gnashing their teeth for months at the city in the Donbass, which has been declared a fortress. Nevertheless: now the fall could be imminent. Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of the Wagner mercenaries, was the main leader. Only the city center and an important street in the west are still under Ukrainian control, but the latter is already within firing range of the besiegers. Meanwhile, the situation report does not officially mention a withdrawal of Ukrainian troops.  With the sentence, the court remained below the demand of the prosecution, which had demanded 13 years and six months in juvenile detention for both defendants, as well as consideration of preventive detention. The defense of the main perpetrator B. had demanded twelve years in juvenile detention, that of V. an acquittal of the murder charge and a suspended sentence for a robbery committed together with B.. The young man followed the instructions of the manual and thus came to the Telegram page of an unknown perpetrator and subsequently made three transfers with a total amount in the lower four-digit euro range. The price pressure from the energy markets was slowly easing, and there were also signs of a slight easing in other commodities and the economy. However, this would be counteracted by rapidly rising food costs and labor market developments, in particular rising wages. In front of the house (l.) the blood crime occurred. Weapons and drugs were found. </Body>

With forged papers and an unusual cargo, a truck driver (48) tried to outsmart the police during a check. However, the intervening police officers did not find a corresponding lamp. The packaging contained only a piece of wood instead of the LED lamp. The man was reported to the Innsbruck public prosecutor's office on suspicion of forgery. A security deposit was collected. In the course of this check, the man presented a waybill for an LED lamp, which confirmed that the lamp had been loaded in Merano. This would have made it possible to drive over the Fernpass. Many Western states and companies would still use RBI to settle the remaining business with Russia. Moreover, the bank is an important institution not only in Russia, but also in Ukraine. With the sentence, the court remained below the demand of the prosecution, which had demanded 13 years and six months of juvenile detention for both defendants, as well as consideration of preventive detention. The defense of the main perpetrator, B., had demanded twelve years in juvenile detention, that of V. an acquittal of the murder charge and a suspended sentence for a robbery committed together with B.. The money that the police charged the activists is not a fine. The climate activists may still have to pay this fine. This will be decided by the courts. Plastic flowers for parliament
Wolfgang Sobotka went it alone: the president of parliament had the head of a German flower house draw up an "overall concept for the floral design" of the building on the Ring. As a result, four huge vases containing plastic cherry blossoms (for 7,500 euros) were set up in the pillared hall (at a cost of 5,000 euros). Other parts of the parliament were also kitsched up; two vases now accompany the golden piano, for example. Sobotka is allowed to do that, he is the "master of the house". Weapons and drugs were found. The four dogs were trapped here.

The South Tower stood over a quarter-mile tall at 1,362 feet.
An earlier bridge was built in 1885 by the Milwaukee Bridge & Iron Works one block east of the current bridge to carry traffic over the river at the foot of Washington Street. It was an iron camelback truss bridge with three spans, supported on stone piers. The northernmost span swung open to allow boats to pass. It had to be operated by a bridge tender, whose house remains at the bridge site to the present day.
On the north side the outer rampart has only two massive towers (20m in diameter, about), one at each angle. They are called Legge Mounts (in the West) and Brass (in the East). On the west side there are no towers except the Byward tower which controls the entrance, and of course the middle towers which are in front of the entrance. The south side faces the Thames, protected by the St. Thomas Tower and two smaller ones, the Cradle Tower and the Well Tower. Finally on the west side the only protection tower is to the south, it is the Develin tower.
A raised floor is constructed with a wooden framework that bridges from one exterior wall to another. This framework may or may not be supported intermediately by girders, beams, or walls.

The bridge was located in the main village of Hillsborough, a short way west (upriver) of the road bridge carrying New Hampshire Route 149. The bridge was a two-span Town lattice truss span, mounted on granite abutments and a central wooden pier, the latter having replaced a granite pier washed away in 1938. It had a total length of 219 feet (67 m), with a gabled roof and exterior finished in vertical board siding. Although the bridge had two spans, the truss was a single element, running continuously across the central pier. Portions of the truss were reinforced by the placement of iron bolts, and there was a sidewalk cantilevered off one side.
The lattice is continuous through the length of the bridge; over 
the position occupied by the center pier there are two pairs of 
boards which extend vertically the full height of the lattice 
and are bolted onto the lattice. A third pair of such boards 
exists in between the other two pairs, but it does not correspond 
to any supportive member beneath the bridge.
The piers divide the facade into five bays 
on the west and seven on the north; each bay is subdivided by mullions extending from 
floors three to sixteen.
